## Notes

### Big Challenges

1.  <b>How do we generate a maze?</b> Many algorithms to generate a maze. We will have to learn a bit about a tree data structure + recursion to implement the simplest algorithm.

2.  <b>How are we going to draw this thing on the screen?</b> Use Matter JS to draw the maze onto a canvas element (brim.io/matter-js)

3.  <b>How do we make some keyboard keys control the ball?</b> Matter JS has the ability to map key presses to movements of shapes.

4.  <b>How do we detect when the ball touches the green square?</b> Matter JS has the ability to detect collisions between different shapes and report them to us as events.
